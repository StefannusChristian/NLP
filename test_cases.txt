1. Tom is one of my friends. I don't expect you to be Tom's friend either. I'm not the only one here who thinks Tom is a nice guy. If Tom would smile more often, he'd probably have more friends.

2. I want to tell you something, but it's a secret. Promise not to tell. I got my driver's license on the second time I tried to pass the driver's test. I don't think I can get you to understand how easy to get driver's license. When I'm good at driving, I'll teach you.
